# cookie-clicker-clone
An idle incremental clicker game

All rights go the original owners. No actual reverse engineering occurred, this is just breaking things down on a surface level basis. There is no save game
functionality, and there's only 10 upgrades and worker types right now. My version looks like shit. So play the original if you want the primo experience.

No binaries here, just copy this into VS Code if you want to play it I guess.
